            "selftext": "I used to be all-in on large language models. Built automations, client tools, business workflows..... hell, entire processes around GPT and similar systems. I thought we were seeing the dawn of a new era. I was wrong.\n\nNothing is reliable. If your workflow needs any real accuracy, consistency, or reproducibility, these models are a liability. Ask the same question twice and get two different answers. Small updates silently break entire chains of logic. It’s like building on quicksand.\n\nThat old line, *“this is the worst it’ll ever be,”* is bullshit. GPT-4.1 workflows that ran perfectly are now useless on GPT-5. Things regress, behaviors shift, context windows hallucinate. You can’t version-lock intelligence that doesn’t actually understand what it’s doing.\n\nThe time and money that go into “guardrailing,” “safety layers,” and “compliance” dwarfs just paying a human to do the work correctly. Worse, the safeguards rarely even function. You end up debugging an AI that won’t admit it’s wrong, wrapped in another AI that can’t explain why.\n\nAnd then there’s the hype machine. Every company is tripping over itself to bolt “AI-powered” onto products that don’t need it. Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini—they’re all mediocre at best, and big tech is starting to realize it. Real productivity gains are vanishingly rare. The MASSIVE reluctance of the business world to say something is simply due to embarrassment of admission. CEO's are literally scrambling to re-hire, or pay  people like ME to come in and fix some truly horrific situations. (I am too busy fixing all of the broken shit on my end to even think about having the time to do this for others. But the phone calls and emails are piling up. Other consultants I speak with say the same thing. Copilot easily being the most requested to be fixed).\n\nRandom, unreliable, and broken systems with zero audit requirements in the US. And I mean ZERO accountability. The amount of plausible deniability massive companies have to purposely or inadvertently harm people is overwhelming. These systems now influence hiring, pay, healthcare, credit, and legal outcomes without auditability, transparency, or regulation. I work with these tools every day, and have from jump. I am confident we are at minimum in a largely stalled performance drought, and at worst, witnessing the absolute floors starting to crumble. ",

I think, at least, that it needs some additional underlying structure to reenforce it— some kind of logic to it so that it “understands” what it’s talking about.\n\nYou probably don’t want it to be completely deterministic, but it should have enough logic to it that if you ask the same question, it’ll give an answer within a consistent range, have its own sense for what it knows and doesn’t know, and not create wild hallucinations (unless you ask it to be creative).\n\nI suspect people got too excited and sprinted ahead of what LLMs can actually handle.\n\nIt reminds me a bit of the early PDA phones, e.g. Windows, Palm, and BlackBerry phones.  They had some cool features for the time, but they weren’t ready to really be used the way people use smartphones today.\n\nOr another example might be Netflix.  They always intended to stream movies, but the technology wasn’t there in the late 90s.  They had to start by limiting themselves to mailing DVDs around.  I think what’s happening now with AI is sort of like if you had a bunch of competing Netlfix-like companies in 2000, spending tons of money and trying to go straight to streaming.  It’s not a bad idea, and they may be going in the right direction, but the technology and infrastructure just isn’t ready for it.",

            "selftext": "So last week Meta reported earnings. Beat expectations on basically everything. Revenue up 26%. $20 billion in profit for the quarter but Stock should've gone up right? Instead it tanked. Dropped 12% in two days. Lost over $200 billion in market value. Worst drop since 2022.\n\nWhy? Because Mark Zuckerberg announced they're spending way more on AI than anyone expected. And when investors asked what they're actually getting for all that money he couldn't give them a straight answer.\n\n**The spending**: Meta raised their 2025 capital expenditure forecast to $70-72 billion. That's just this year. Then Zuckerberg said next year will be \"notably larger.\" Didn't give a number. Just notably larger. Reports came out saying Meta's planning $600 billion in AI infrastructure spending over the next three years. For context that's more than the GDP of most countries. Operating expenses jumped $7 billion year over year. Nearly $20 billion in capital expense. All going to AI talent and infrastructure.\n\nDuring the earnings call investors kept asking the same question. What are you building? When will it make money? Zuckerberg's answer was basically \"trust me bro we need the compute for superintelligence.\"\n\nHe said \"The right thing to do is to try to accelerate this to make sure that we have the compute that we need both for the AI research and new things that we're doing.\"\n\nInvestors pressed harder. Give us specifics. What products? What revenue?\n\nHis response: \"We're building truly frontier models with novel capabilities. There will be many new products in different content formats. There are also business versions. This is just a massive latent opportunity.\" Then he added \"there will be more to share in the coming months.\"\n\nThat's it. Coming months. Trust the process. The market said no thanks and dumped the stock.\n\nOther companies are spending big on AI too. Google raised their capex forecast to $91-93 billion. Microsoft said spending will keep growing. But their stocks didn't crash. Why Because they can explain what they're getting.\n\n* Microsoft has Azure. Their cloud business is growing because enterprises are paying them to use AI tools. Clear revenue. Clear product. Clear path to profit.\n* Google has search. AI is already integrated into their ads and recommendations. Making them money right now.\n* Nvidia sells the chips everyone's buying. Direct revenue from AI boom.\n* OpenAI is spending crazy amounts but they're also pulling in $20 billion a year in revenue from ChatGPT which has 300 million weekly users.\n\nMeta? They don't have any of that.\n\n98% of Meta's revenue still comes from ads on Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp. Same as it's always been. They're spending tens of billions on AI but can't point to a single product that's generating meaningful revenue from it.\n\nThe Metaverse déjà vu is that This is feeling like 2021-2022 all over again.\n\nBack then Zuckerberg bet everything on the Metaverse. Changed the company name from Facebook to Meta. Spent $36 billion on Reality Labs over three years. Stock crashed 77% from peak to bottom. Lost over $600 billion in market value.\n\nWhy? Because he was spending massive amounts on a vision that wasn't making money and investors couldn't see when it would.\n\nNow it's happening again. Except this time it's AI instead of VR.\n\nWhat Meta's actually building?\n\nDuring the call Zuckerberg kept mentioning their \"Superintelligence team.\" Four months ago he restructured Meta's AI division. Created a new group focused on building superintelligence. That's AI smarter than humans.\n\n* He hired Alexandr Wang from Scale AI to lead it. Paid $14.3 billion to bring him in.\n* They're building two massive data centers. Each one uses as much electricity as a small city.\n\nBut when analysts asked what products will come out of all this Zuckerberg just said \"we'll share more in coming months.\"\n\nHe mentioned Meta AI their ChatGPT competitor. Mentioned something called Vibes. Hinted at \"business AI\" products.\n\nBut nothing concrete. No launch dates. No revenue projections. Just vague promises.\n\nThe only thing he could point to was AI making their current ad business slightly better. More engagement on Facebook and Instagram. 14% higher ad prices.\n\nThat's nice but it doesn't justify spending $70 billion this year and way more next year.\n\n**Here's the issue -** Zuckerberg's betting on superintelligence arriving soon. He said during the call \"if superintelligence arrives sooner we will be ideally positioned for a generational paradigm shift.\" But what if it doesn't? What if it takes longer?\n\nHis answer: \"If it takes longer then we'll use the extra compute to accelerate our core business which continues to be able to profitably use much more compute than we've been able to throw at it.\"\n\nSo the backup plan is just make ads better. That's it.\n\nYou're spending $600 billion over three years and the contingency is maybe your ad targeting gets 20% more efficient.\n\nInvestors looked at that math and said this doesn't add up.\n\nSo what's Meta actually buying with all this cash?\n\n* Nvidia chips. Tons of them. H100s and the new Blackwell chips cost $30-40k each. Meta's buying hundreds of thousands.\n* Data centers. Building out massive facilities to house all those chips. Power. Cooling. Infrastructure.\n* Talent. Paying top AI researchers and engineers. Competing with OpenAI Google and Anthropic for the same people.\n\nAnd here's the kicker. A lot of that money is going to other big tech companies.\n\n* They rent cloud capacity from AWS Google Cloud and Azure when they need extra compute. So Meta's paying Amazon Google and Microsoft.\n* They buy chips from Nvidia. Software from other vendors. Infrastructure from construction companies.\n\nIt's the same circular spending problem we talked about before. These companies are passing money back and forth while claiming it's economic growth.\n\n**The comparison that hurts** \\- Sam Altman can justify OpenAI's massive spending because ChatGPT is growing like crazy. 300 million weekly users. $20 billion annual revenue. Satya Nadella can justify Microsoft's spending because Azure is growing. Enterprise customers paying for AI tools.\n\nWhat can Zuckerberg point to? Facebook and Instagram users engaging slightly more because of AI recommendations. That's it.\n\nDuring the call he said \"it's pretty early but I think we're seeing the returns in the core business.\"\n\nInvestors heard \"pretty early\" and bailed.\n\n**Why this matters :**\n\nMeta is one of the Magnificent 7 stocks that make up 37% of the S&P 500. When Meta loses $200 billion in market value that drags down the entire index. Your 401k probably felt it.And this isn't just about Meta. It's a warning shot for all the AI spending happening right now.If Wall Street starts questioning whether these massive AI investments will actually pay off we could see a broader sell-off. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet all spending similar amounts. If Meta can't justify it what makes their spending different?\n\nThe answer better be really good or this becomes a pattern.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nMeta reported strong Q3 earnings. Revenue up 26% $20 billion profit. Then announced they're spending $70-72 billion on AI in 2025 and \"notably larger\" in 2026. Reports say $600 billion over three years. Zuckerberg couldn't explain what products they're building or when they'll make money. Said they need compute for \"superintelligence\" and there will be \"more to share in coming months.\" Stock crashed 12% lost $200 billion in market value. Worst drop since 2022. Investors comparing it to 2021-2022 metaverse disaster when Meta spent $36B and stock lost 77%. 98% of revenue still comes from ads. No enterprise business like Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud. Only AI product is making current ads slightly better. One analyst said it mirrors metaverse spending with unknown revenue opportunity. Meta's betting everything on superintelligence arriving soon. If it doesn't backup plan is just better ad targeting. Wall Street not buying it anymore.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/02/meta-has-an-ai-product-problem/](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/02/meta-has-an-ai-product-problem/)",

            "selftext": "So this dropped yesterday and it's actually wild.\n\nSeptember 2025. Anthropic detected suspicious activity on Claude. Started investigating.\n\nTurns out it was Chinese state-sponsored hackers. They used Claude Code to hack into roughly 30 companies. Big tech companies, Banks, Chemical manufacturers and Government agencies.\n\nThe AI did 80-90% of the hacking work. Humans only had to intervene 4-6 times per campaign.\n\nAnthropic calls this \"the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention.\"\n\nThe hackers convinced Claude to hack for them. Then Claude analyzed targets -> spotted vulnerabilities -> wrote exploit code -> harvested passwords -> extracted data and documented everything. All by itself.\n\nClaude's trained to refuse harmful requests. So how'd they get it to hack?\n\nThey jailbroke it. Broke the attack into small innocent-looking tasks. Told Claude it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm doing defensive testing. Claude had no idea it was actually hacking real companies.\n\nThe hackers used Claude Code which is Anthropic's coding tool. It can search the web retrieve data run software. Has access to password crackers, network scanners and security tools.\n\nSo they set up a framework. Pointed it at a target. Let Claude run autonomously.\n\nPhase 1: Claude inspected the target's systems. Found their highest-value databases. Did it way faster than human hackers could.\n\nPhase 2: Found security vulnerabilities. Wrote exploit code to break in.\n\nPhase 3: Harvested credentials. Usernames and passwords. Got deeper access.\n\nPhase 4: Extracted massive amounts of private data. Sorted it by intelligence value.\n\nPhase 5: Created backdoors for future access. Documented everything for the human operators.\n\nThe AI made thousands of requests per second. Attack speed impossible for humans to match.\n\nAnthropic said \"human involvement was much less frequent despite the larger scale of the attack.\"\n\nBefore this hackers used AI as an advisor. Ask it questions. Get suggestions. But humans did the actual work.\n\nNow? AI does the work. Humans just point it in the right direction and check in occasionally.\n\nAnthropic detected it banned the accounts notified victims coordinated with authorities. Took 10 days to map the full scope.\n\nBut the thing is they only caught it because it was their AI. If the hackers used a different model Anthropic wouldn't know.\n\nThe irony is Anthropic built Claude Code as a productivity tool. Help developers write code faster. Automate boring tasks. Chinese hackers used that same tool to automate hacking.\n\nAnthropic's response? \"The very abilities that allow Claude to be used in these attacks also make it crucial for cyber defense.\"\n\nThey used Claude to investigate the attack. Analyzed the enormous amounts of data the hackers generated.\n\nSo Claude hacked 30 companies. Then Claude investigated itself hacking those companies.\n\nMost companies would keep this quiet. Don't want people knowing their AI got used for espionage.\n\nAnthropic published a full report. Explained exactly how the hackers did it. Released it publicly.\n\nWhy? Because they know this is going to keep happening. Other hackers will use the same techniques. On Claude on ChatGPT on every AI that can write code.\n\nThey're basically saying \"here's how we got owned so you can prepare.\"\n\nAI agents can now hack at scale with minimal human involvement.\n\nLess experienced hackers can do sophisticated attacks. Don't need a team of experts anymore. Just need one person who knows how to jailbreak an AI and point it at targets.\n\nThe barriers to cyberattacks just dropped massively.\n\nAnthropic said \"these attacks are likely to only grow in their effectiveness.\"\n\nEvery AI company is releasing coding agents right now. OpenAI has one. Microsoft has Copilot. Google has Gemini Code Assist.\n\nAll of them can be jailbroken. All of them can write exploit code. All of them can run autonomously.\n\nThe uncomfortable question is If your AI can be used to hack 30 companies should you even release it?\n\nAnthropic's answer is yes because defenders need AI too. Security teams can use Claude to detect threats analyze vulnerabilities respond to incidents.\n\nIt's an arms race. Bad guys get AI. Good guys need AI to keep up.\n\nBut right now the bad guys are winning. They hacked 30 companies before getting caught. And they only got caught because Anthropic happened to notice suspicious activity on their own platform.\n\nHow many attacks are happening on other platforms that nobody's detecting?\n\nNobody's talking about the fact that this proves AI safety training doesn't work.\n\nClaude has \"extensive\" safety training. Built to refuse harmful requests. Has guardrails specifically against hacking.\n\nDidn't matter. Hackers jailbroke it by breaking tasks into small pieces and lying about the context.\n\nEvery AI company claims their safety measures prevent misuse. This proves those measures can be bypassed.\n\nAnd once you bypass them you get an AI that can hack better and faster than human teams.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nChinese state-sponsored hackers used Claude Code to hack roughly 30 companies in Sept 2025. Targeted big tech banks chemical companies government agencies. AI did 80-90% of work. Humans only intervened 4-6 times per campaign. Anthropic calls it first large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention. Hackers jailbroke Claude by breaking tasks into innocent pieces and lying said Claude worked for legitimate cybersecurity firm. Claude analyzed targets found vulnerabilities wrote exploits harvested passwords extracted data created backdoors documented everything autonomously. Made thousands of requests per second impossible speed for humans. Anthropic caught it after 10 days banned accounts notified victims. Published full public report explaining exactly how it happened. Says attacks will only grow more effective. Every coding AI can be jailbroken and used this way. Proves AI safety training can be bypassed. Arms race between attackers and defenders both using AI.\n\n**Source:**\n\n[https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage](https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage)",

            "selftext": "Last month Google quietly removed the `num=100` search parameter, the trick that let you see 100 results on one page instead of the default 10. It sounds small, but it is not. You can no longer view 100 results at once. The new hard limit is 10.\n\nHere is why this matters. Most large language models like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity rely directly or indirectly on Google's indexed results to feed their retrieval systems and crawlers. By cutting off the long tail of results, Google just reduced what these systems can see by roughly 90 percent. The web just got shallower not only for humans but for AI as well.\n\nThe impact was immediate. According to Search Engine Land, about 88 percent of websites saw a drop in impressions. Sites that ranked in positions 11 to 100 basically disappeared. Reddit, which often ranks deep in search results, saw its LLM citations drop sharply.\n\nThis is not just an SEO story. It is an AI supply chain issue. Google quietly made it harder for external models to access the depth of the web. The training data pipeline that fuels modern AI just got thinner.\n\nFor startups this change is brutal. Visibility is harder. Organic discovery is weaker. Even if you build a great product, no one will find it unless you first crack distribution. If people cannot find you they will never get to evaluate you.\n\nGoogle did not just tweak a search setting. It reshaped how information flows online and how AI learns from it.

Most major models don’t scrape Google results directly; they use their own indexes (Perplexity), licensed datasets, or search APIs that abstract Google entirely. **Cutting off the 100-results view doesn’t block access to content.  It only changes how a human or scraper can** ***view*** **it.**\n\nAlso, retrieval isn’t the future of AI visibility... memory is. Models are starting to rely more on internal knowledge, curated corpora, and fine-tuned memory layers rather than live scraping. As local and edge inference become more common, the dependency on Google’s live index will keep shrinking to (almost) nothing IMO.\n\nSo yes, it’s an interesting signal about how Google protects its data pipeline, but calling it a 90% reduction in what “AI can see” is way off.

It’s been shown to help reduce poverty, improve people’s mental health, and even make some people more productive. The thing is, as robots and AI make more money for companies, there’ll be enough resources to fund things like UBI. The idea that governments would just let billions of people starve doesn’t really make sense—they’d risk total chaos, which nobody wants.\n\n\n\t2.\tThe Elite Need Stability Too\nThink about it: if billions of people were starving in the streets, how long would society last before everything collapsed? The rich and powerful might have big houses and private security, but they still rely on a stable world. History shows that when inequality gets too extreme, things blow up—look at revolutions in the past. It’s way smarter (and safer) for them to keep people happy enough to avoid that. UBI or some other kind of support system would be a way to keep things under control.\n\n\n\t3.\tPeople Are Better Than You Think\nYeah, the world isn’t perfect, but people aren’t completely heartless either. Look at all the progress humanity has made—ending slavery, expanding rights, fighting for justice. If things got as bad as you’re predicting, you can bet there would be massive public outcry. Even people in power would feel the pressure to act, and plenty of them actually care about being seen as doing the right thing. We’re not at the point where the whole world would just sit back and watch billions starve.\n\n\n\t4.\tHumans Still Have Value\nEven if robots and AI are doing most of the work, humans still matter. People create art, culture, ideas, and communities. No matter how advanced machines get, they can’t replace human connection or creativity. Plus, the economy still needs people as consumers—there’s no point in producing tons of goods and services if nobody can afford them. The idea that we’d become completely useless doesn’t hold up.\n\n\n\t5.\tPopulation Control Isn’t Some Dark Plot\nPopulation decline is already happening naturally in developed countries. When people have better education and healthcare, they tend to have fewer kids. There’s no need for some evil plan to wipe people out. The population is already leveling off on its own in many parts of the world, and it’s happening in a way that’s peaceful and manageable.\n\n\nIn short, the doom-and-gloom scenario you’re describing doesn’t really match how the world works. Humans have always found ways to adapt to big changes, and while the future might be bumpy, it’s way more likely that we’ll figure out solutions—like UBI—than just collapse into some nightmare where billions of people starve.",

            "selftext": "ok this is actually insane and I can't believe this isn't bigger news.\n\nSo Nvidia just agreed to give OpenAI $100 billion. Sounds normal right? Big investment in AI. Except here's what OpenAI does with that money. They turn around and buy Nvidia chips with it.\n\nRead that again. Nvidia is giving a company $100 billion so that company can buy Nvidia products. And Wall Street is just cool with this apparently?\n\nBut that's just the start. I found [this](https://www.bain.com/insights/how-can-we-meet-ais-insatiable-demand-for-compute-power-technology-report-2025/) Bain report that nobody's really covered and the numbers are absolutely fucked. They calculated that by 2030 AI companies need to make $2 trillion in revenue just to cover what they're spending on infrastructure. Their realistic projection? These companies will make $1.2 trillion.\n\nThey're gonna be $800 billion short. Not million. Billion with a B.\n\nAnd it gets dumber. OpenAI is gonna burn $115 billion by 2029. They've never made a profit. Not once. But they're somehow valued at $500 billion which makes them literally the most valuable company in human history that's never turned a profit.\n\nSam Altman keeps saying they need trillions for infrastructure. Zuckerberg's spending hundreds of billions on data centers. And for what? MIT just published research showing 95% of companies that invested in AI got absolutely nothing back. Zero ROI. Then Harvard found that AI is actually making workers LESS productive because they're creating garbage content that wastes everyone's time.\n\nEven the tech isn't working how they said it would. Remember when GPT-5 was supposed to be this huge leap? It came out and everyone was like oh that's it? Altman literally admitted they're \"missing something important\" to get to AGI. The whole plan was throw more compute at it and it'll get smarter and that's just not happening anymore.\n\nMeanwhile Chinese companies are building models for like 1% of what US companies spend. So even if this works the margins are cooked.\n\nThe debt situation is actually scary. Meta borrowed $26 billion for ONE data center. Banks are putting together a $22 billion loan for more data centers. OpenAI wants to do debt financing now instead of just taking Microsoft's money. This is all borrowed money betting on a future that might not happen.\n\nThis is exactly what happened in 1999 with telecom companies and fiber optic cables. They all built massive infrastructure betting demand would show up. Most of them went bankrupt.\n\nOpenAI's CFO literally suggested charging people $2000 a month for ChatGPT in the future. Two thousand dollars a month. That's their plan to make the math work.\n\nWe already got a preview in January when DeepSeek dropped a competitive model that cost almost nothing to build. The market lost a trillion dollars in value in one day. Nvidia crashed 17%. Then everyone just went back to pretending everything's fine.\n\nEven the bulls know this is cooked. Zuckerberg straight up said this is probably a bubble but he's more scared of not spending enough. Altman admitted investors are overexcited. Jeff Bezos called it an industrial bubble. They all know but they can't stop because if you stop spending and your competitors don't you're dead.\n\nChatGPT has 700 million users a week which sounds amazing until you realize they lose money on every single person who uses it. The entire business model is lose money now and hope you can charge enough later to make it back.\n\nI'm calling it now. This is gonna be worse than dot-com. Way worse. Some companies will survive but most of this is going to zero and a lot of very smart people are gonna lose absolutely stupid amounts of money.\n\nTLDR: Nvidia just invested $100B in OpenAI who then uses that money to buy Nvidia chips. AI companies will be $800B short of breaking even by 2030. MIT found 95% of companies got zero ROI from AI. This is about to get ugly.",

As declining wages suppress consumer demand, governments intervene with massive debt-financed spending on technology and infrastructure to maintain economic activity. Central banks accommodate by expanding the money supply, causing inflation that erodes the real value of debt—effectively repaying borrowed funds with devalued currency. This cycle transfers wealth from wage earners to capital holders, sustains demand artificially through monetary inflation, and risks creating a self-reinforcing loop of inequality, dependency on stimulus, and long-term economic instability unless counterbalanced by redistribution, regulation, or new economic paradigms.",

Every major technological leap starts as a money pit. Why? Because it’s building the infrastructure for the next era, not making instant profits.\n\nYes, AI infrastructure spending looks insane right now. So did the early internet. In 1999, everyone mocked fiber-optic companies for overbuilding, as you do in your argument. Ten years later, that same “wasted” fiber became the backbone of the modern web, video streaming, and cloud computing. What looked like overinvestment was actually early investment. It’s like saying airplanes were a bad idea because the Wright brothers didn’t turn a profit on day one.\n\nAnd about Nvidia “giving OpenAI $100 billion to buy Nvidia chips”? That’s not circular, that’s how ecosystems work. Nvidia isn’t donating money, it’s investing to lock in a customer and a market. Every chip sold reinforces their dominance. It’s vertical integration.\n\nSo yeah, I agree some valuations are frothy, some companies are reckless, and some projects will go nowhere. But the underlying trend is inevitable. AI is the next layer of human infrastructure. Call it a bubble if you want. Just remember people said the same thing about the internet, right before it took over the world.",

            "selftext": "So, Eric Schmidt, who was Google’s CEO for a solid decade, recently spoke at a Stanford University conference. The guy was really letting loose, sharing all sorts of insider thoughts. At one point, he got super serious and told the students that the meeting was confidential, urging them not to spill the beans.  \n\n\nBut here’s the kicker: the organizers then told him the whole thing was being live-streamed. And yeah, his face froze. Stanford later took the video down from YouTube, but the internet never forgets—people had already archived it. Check out a full transcript backup on Github by searching \"Stanford\\_ECON295⧸CS323\\_I\\_2024\\_I\\_The\\_Age\\_of\\_AI,\\_Eric\\_Schmidt.txt\"  \n\n\nHere’s the TL;DR of what he said:\n\n• Google’s losing in AI because it cares too much about work-life balance. Schmidt’s basically saying, “If your team’s only showing up one day a week, how are you gonna beat OpenAI or Anthropic?”\n\n• He’s got a lot of respect for Elon Musk and TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) because they push their employees hard. According to Schmidt, you need to keep the pressure on to win. TSMC even makes physics PhDs work on factory floors in their first year. Can you imagine American PhDs doing that?\n\n• Schmidt admits he’s made some bad calls, like dismissing NVIDIA’s CUDA. Now, CUDA is basically NVIDIA’s secret weapon, with all the big AI models running on it, and no other chips can compete.\n\n• He was shocked when Microsoft teamed up with OpenAI, thinking they were too small to matter. But turns out, he was wrong. He also threw some shade at Apple, calling their approach to AI too laid-back.\n\n• Schmidt threw in a cheeky comment about TikTok, saying if you’re starting a business, go ahead and “steal” whatever you can, like music. If you make it big, you can afford the best lawyers to cover your tracks.\n\n• OpenAI’s Stargate might cost way more than expected—think $300 billion, not $100 billion. Schmidt suggested the U.S. either get cozy with Canada for their hydropower and cheap labor or buddy up with Arab nations for funding.\n\n• Europe? Schmidt thinks it’s a lost cause for tech innovation, with Brussels killing opportunities left and right. He sees a bit of hope in France but not much elsewhere. He’s also convinced the U.S. has lost China and that India’s now the most important ally.\n\n• As for open-source in AI? Schmidt’s not so optimistic. He says it’s too expensive for open-source to handle, and even a French company he’s invested in, Mistral, is moving towards closed-source.\n\n• AI, according to Schmidt, will make the rich richer and the poor poorer. It’s a game for strong countries, and those without the resources might be left behind.\n\n• Don’t expect AI chips to bring back manufacturing jobs. Factories are mostly automated now, and people are too slow and dirty to compete. Apple moving its MacBook production to Texas isn’t about cheap labor—it’s about not needing much labor at all.\n\n• Finally, Schmidt compared AI to the early days of electricity. It’s got huge potential, but it’s gonna take a while—and some serious organizational innovation—before we see the real benefits. Right now, we’re all just picking the low-hanging fruit.",

I don't mean in a moral sense, to be clear.\n\nThe one thing I'd dispute is his notion that Google is behind in AI because of work-life balance.\n\nPerhaps this is one factor of many, but it's not \"the reason.\"\n\nI think it's largely due to the fact that Google has become a large bureaucracy. It's the IBM of the 21st century.\n\nOpenAI has literally one job - to make the best, most efficient AI possible. That's basically all they do. The company is pretty small - around 2.5k employees.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet is a sprawling conglomerate. There's so many competing demands and products. When Google works on Gemini, they need to figure out how it fits into Chrome. They need to balance budget needs against other divisions. There's many more layers of approval and review.\n\nIt's basically a real world demonstration of complexity theory. As a company grows in size, the amount of effort required to simply manage the organizational complexity grows with it, thereby reducing the amount of time spent in, say, developing the product.\n\nDeepMind was founded 5 years before OpenAI, and purchased by Google a full year before OpenAI was founded. DeepMind was THE cutting edge of AI, at the time.\n\nSo Google had the capability. It had the money. But it wasn't focusing on DeepMind. It was basically just another interesting research product. Google spent far more money refining its advertising system than it did on AI development.\n\nFurthermore - Schmidt's observation doesn't even make sense on a mathematical level. Google absolutely dwarfs OpenAI. OpenAI has 2500 employees - and a lot of those probably have nothing to do with actually building AI (HR, marketing, administrative assistants, etc ).\n\nEven if OpenAI's staff was putting in 1.5 FTE, that only equals 3.75k FTE...3750 employees is *nothing* for a company the size of Google - they have almost 200k employees, and a huge contractor force.\n\nIf Google wanted, it could just put 20k employees on its AI project. At which point, they have 10x the man hours available to OpenAI. No amount of overtime from OpenAI can make that up.\n\nSo this isn't about how many hours a few people at OpenAI are spending at work on the weekends. The reason Google is behind is because it's a sprawling bureaucracy that lost sight of what was important, and is now getting bested by a smaller, more agile competitor. It's a story as old as time - and Google of all companies should know, because they were once in the same position as OpenAI.\n\nSo Schmidt is basically just blaming Google's employees for what really amounts to a strategic failure of management.",

If you’ve got years of experience, you’re likely still ahead of AI in your specific role today. But that’s not my reality. I’m talking about new grads like me. Major corporations, from Big Tech to finance, are already slashing entry level hires. Companies like Google and Meta have said in investor calls and hiring reports they’re slowing or pausing campus recruitment for roles like mine by 2025 and 2026. That’s not a hunch, it’s public record.\n\nSome of you try to help by pointing out “there are jobs today.” I hear you, but I’m not graduating tomorrow. I’ve got 1.5 years left, and by then, the job market for new CIS (or most all) grads could be a wasteland. AI has already eaten roughly 90 percent of entry level non physical roles. Don’t throw out exceptions like “cybersecurity’s still hiring” or “my buddy got a dev job.” Those are outliers, not the trend. The trend is automation wiping out software engineering, data analysis, and IT support gigs faster than universities can churn out degrees.\n\nIt’s not just my class either. There are over 2 billion people worldwide, from newborns to high schoolers, who haven’t even hit the job market yet. That’s billions of future workers, many who’ll be skilled and eager, flooding into whatever jobs remain. When you say “there are jobs,” you’re ignoring how the leftover 10 percent of openings get mobbed by overqualified grads and laid off mid level pros. I’m not here for cliches about upskilling or networking tougher. I want real talk on Reddit. Is anyone else seeing this cliff coming? What’s your plan when the entry level door slams shut?",

The extent to which AI has 'replaced' these position VS simply not having them filled due to junior level being the least profitable in R&D roles is still yet to be disentangled, we won't know until the economy settles down.\n\nI think what is *useful* as a comparator is this - if this is a technological change, ie, these jobs are gone because of AI, not economics, then we would expect to see the elimination of '90% of entry level positions' across all national economies who have access to this technology.\n\nSo, that would be China, India, Russia, western AND Eastern Europe.\n\nHowever, I do not see this reflected. China \"over produces\" engineers and maintains essentially full employment without suffering reduced profits.\n\nHiring is up in both Eastern Europe and India.\n\nWhere do we see these 90% reductions? In national economies that are closely tied to the united states and it's financial/political system.\n\n\n\nThese tools may somewhat reduce employment but the idea that 90% of all of an industry's workforce is redundant because extremely expensive, top level language models can one-shot basic crud apps (and still frequently catastrophically fail, as we have seen with vibe coded security issues) does not stand.",

            "selftext": "**TLDR**\n\n* **An overview of the best legal AI tools I've used is** [**on my profile here**](https://www.reddit.com/user/h0l0gramco/comments/1i5zptw/ai_tools_that_i_use_as_a_lawyer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)**.**  I have no affiliation nor interest in any tool, and I will not discuss them in this sub.\n* **Manageable Hours**: I used to work 60–70 hours a week in BigLaw to far less now.\n* **Quality + Client Satisfaction**: Faster legal drafting, fewer mistakes, happier clients.\n* **Ethical Duty**: We owe it to clients to use AI-powered legal tools that help us deliver better, faster service.  Importantly, we owe it to ourselves to have a better life.\n* **No Single “Winner”**: The nuance of legal reasoning and case strategy is what's hard to replicate.  Real breakthroughs may come from lawyers.\n* **Don’t Ignore It**: We won’t be replaced, but lawyers and firms that resist AI will fall behind.\n\n**Previous Posts**\n\nI tried posting a longer version on r/Lawyertalk (removed).  For me, this about *a fundamental shift in legal practice through AI that lawyers need to realize*.  Generally, it seems like many corners of the legal community aren't ready for this discussion; however, we owe it to our clients and ourselves to do better.\n\n*And yes, I used AI to polish this*.  But this is also quite literally how I speak/write; I'm a lawyer.\n\n**About Me**\n\nI’m an attorney at a large U.S. firm and have been practicing for over a decade.  I've always disliked our  business model.  Am I always worth $975 per hour?  Sometimes yes, often no - but that's what we bill.  Even ten years in, I sometimes worked insane 60–70 hours a week, including all-nighters.  Now, I produce better legal work in fewer hours, and my clients love it (and most importantly, I love it).  The reason?  AI tools for lawyers.\n\n**Time & Stress**\n\nDrafts that once took 5 hours are down to 45 minutes b/c AI handles legal document automation and first drafts.  I verify the legal aspects instead of slogging through boilerplate or coming up with a different way to say \"for the avoidance of doubt...\".  No more 2 a.m. panic over missed references.\n\n**Billing & Ethics**\n\nWe lean more on flat-fee billing for legal work — b/c AI helps us forecast time better, and clients appreciate the transparency.  We “trust but verify” the end product.\n\nMy approach:\n\n1. Legal AI tools → Handles the first draft.\n2. Lawyer review → Ensures correctness and strategy.\n3. Client gets a better product, faster.\n\nEthically, we owe clients better solutions.  We also work with legal malpractice insurers, and they’re actively asking about AI usage—it’s becoming a best practice for law firms/law firm operations.\n\nAdditionally, as attorneys, we have an ethical obligation to provide the best possible legal representation. Yet, I’m watching colleagues burn out from 70-hour weeks, get divorced, or leave the profession entirely, all while resisting AI-powered legal tech that could help them.\n\nThe resistance to AI in legal practice isn’t just stubborn... it’s holding the profession back.\n\n**Current Landscape**\n\nI’ve tested practically every AI tool for law firms. Each has its strengths, but there’s no dominant player yet.\n\nThe tech companies don't understand how lawyers think.  Nuanced legal reasoning and case analysis aren’t easy to replicate.  The biggest AI impact may come from lawyers, not just tech developers. There's so much to change other than just how lawyers work - take the inundated court systems for example.\n\n**Why It Matters**\n\nI don't think lawyers will be replaced, BUT lawyers who ignore legal AI risk being overtaken by those willing to integrate it responsibly.  It can do the gruntwork so we can do real legal analysis and actually provide real value back to our clients.    \n  \nPersonally, I couldn't practice law again w/o AI. This isn’t just about efficiency. It’s about survival, sanity, and better outcomes.\n\nToday's my day off, so I'm happy to chat and discuss.\n\n**Edit:** A number of folks have asked me if this just means we'll end up billing fewer hours. Maybe for some. But personally, I’m doing *more* impactful work- higher-level thinking, better results, and way less mental drag on figuring how to phrase something. It’s not about working less. It’s about working *better*.",

Everyone else claims it can't do anything to help them.

The tech baseline is very low and AI won't be of much help. In many orgs, technology needs to be updated and processes need to be improved before AI can have a solid impact that's reliable and sustainable. Examples are contracting and e-discovery.\n\n&nbsp;\n- AI adoption in legal costs jobs. Anyone saying that it doesn't is either lying or doesn't have a big enough picture to see the change. Low complexity work like NDA agreements and general paralegal/associate tasks are being targeted by management for replacement by AI. Once they solve the quality problem, this will increase. Outside of management, most  legal professionals don't want to put their jobs at risk so there is a lot of pressure to execute right now and look down on AI. Legal tech adoption is notoriously slow and no one wants to disrupt the status quo or client billable.\n\n&nbsp;\n- GRC. Legal is ultimately about risk management in many instances and there is a fundamental misunderstanding of how Generative AI works and how data is processed in most firms. Many orgs are wary of how data is processed, data residency and IP laws.

It seems like the tech industry is in this race to slap AI onto everything without considering whether it genuinely adds value. That \"helpful\" AI can quickly become intrusive when it tries to guide every step of our creative and personal processes.\n\nIt feels like there should be a balance: AI can be a powerful tool when it’s doing the heavy lifting in the background or solving specific problems, but it shouldn’t get in the way of our own thoughts, creativity, and autonomy. Maybe the tech industry needs to focus more on creating options for users to decide when and where they actually want AI involved, rather than making it unavoidable.",

            "selftext": "Alright, so apparently OpenAI just released an update and with that They quietly *redesigned the entire AI stack* ***again.***\n\nThey dropped this thing called **Agent Kit,** basically, you can now build agents that actually *talk to apps*. Not just chatbots. Real agents that open Notion pages, send Slack messages, check emails, book stuff, all by themselves. The way it works is Drag-and-drop logic + tool connectors + guardrails. People are already calling it “n8n for AI”  - but better integrated.\n\nOpenAI has killed many startups … small automation suites, wrappers … betting on being specialized. There’s this idea in startup circles: once a big platform acquires feature parity + reach, your wrapper / niche tool dies.\n\nHere's what else is landed along with Agent SDK - \n\n**Apps SDK** : you can now build apps that *live inside ChatGPT*; demos showed Canva, Spotify, Zillow working in-chat (ask, click, act). That means ChatGPT can call real services and UIs not just text anymore.\n\n**Sora 2** **API :** higher-quality video + generated audio + cameos with API access coming soon. This will blow up short-form content creation and deepfake conversations  and OpenAI is already adding controls for rights holders.\n\n**o1 (reinforcement-trained reasoning model)** : OpenAI’s “think more” model family that was trained with large-scale RL to improve reasoning on hard tasks. This is the backbone for more deliberative agents.\n\n**tl;dr:**  \n  \nOpenAI just went full Thanos.  \nHalf the startup ecosystem? Gone.  \nThe rest of us? Time to evolve or disappear.",

We designed the game.\n\nBut just because you know how it works, doesn't mean you can predict each hand.\n\nAI models are essentially a bit like card counters at blackjack. They are using statistical weights/measures to make a calculated decision about what the correct answer will be.\n\nThe AI takes inputs, like a card counter looks at their hand. The AI also looks for contextual clues, such as the other cards on the Blackjack table, the number of decks in the shoe, the fundamental rules of the game, etc.\n\nAnd based on that information, the \"card counter\" makes an educated guess. In aggregate, those guesses are correct more often than not.

I love following you guys and hearing your thoughts.\n\nMy observation as a layperson is this: comments here on the topic of AI taking jobs have drastically changed in the past 6 months. A year ago, 2 years ago, ppl here kept saying they’d never lose their jobs. Just have to learn to use AI within their job. \n\nEspecially coders. If you go back to old comments they were fervent about being irreplaceable. At the time I saw a lot of young ppl in my life learning coding and getting jobs. Federal government, local cable company, manufacturer - ppl I know got coding jobs there. What they described as their daily work reminded me of Fred Flinstone working in the rock quarry. He moved his pile of rocks all day then went home when the whistle blew. He didn’t know the scope or goals of the overall quarry business.  It seemed obvious those jobs could become automated.\n\nNow there are a bunch of doom posts about jobs evaporating. \n\nThe answer probably lies somewhere in the middle. What you guys don’t realize is how knowledgeable you are. The vast majority of people really don’t know how technology works. Most of you true tech folks are unicorns you just don’t know it. I think if you put your mind on what’s needed in the greater marketplace you’ll still be successful. It’ll just look different than what you originally trained for.",

Agentic systems are now creating huge application layers at a moment's notice, so the trick is not in creating new products yourself but actually curating and organizing huge chunks of generated code so that it actually makes sense. It becomes a very *meta* game, as in, how do you know what you get is good enough, how do you know it matches demand?\n\nThe problem with all of this is we're reaching levels of complexity where human understanding just isn't fast enough, and often you end up with black boxes that 'just work' but you no longer have any idea *how or why* they work, all you can reasonably do is write some tests and see that they pass and cover your usage scenario. This has certain implications such as for security – you cannot prove the system cannot be tricked and doesn't have a back door because it's just too complex.\n\nPersonally I think there is no choice but to embrace change and try to build something new out of it all. AI does open new doors, but it places greater, not lesser, demands on its users: you now have to be an expert in a great many things, and with all this newfound power comes a major responsibility to maintain this power, keep it organized and well-functioning.",

            "selftext": "So Jensen Huang keeps saying the most contradictory stuff and I don't get why nobody's calling it out.\n\nFebruary 2024. World Government Summit. Huang gets on stage and drops this: \"Nobody needs to program anymore. AI handles it. Programming language is human now. Everybody in the world is now a programmer.\" Tells people to focus on biology manufacturing farming. Not coding. AI's got that covered.\n\nI remember seeing that and thinking okay so I guess all these CS majors are screwed now.\n\nOctober 2025. Same guy. Complete 180.\n\nNow he's telling Gen Z skip coding and become plumbers, electricians and carpenters instead. Says AI boom creating massive demand for skilled trades. Data centers need physical infrastructure.\n\nHe said - \"If you're an electrician, a plumber. a carpenter we're going to need hundreds of thousands of them. If I were a student today I'd choose physical sciences over software.\"\n\nI had to read this twice. So are we all programmers now or should we all be plumbers or electricians ? Which one is it?\n\nHere's what clicked for me -\n\nHuang runs Nvidia right. Makes the chips that power AI. His whole job is hyping AI so people buy more GPUs. When he says \"everyone's a programmer now\" he's literally just selling you on AI tools. More people using AI means more compute power needed means more Nvidia chips getting sold. When he says \"become a plumber\" it's because they're building all these massive data centers and can't find enough electricians and plumbers to actually wire them up and keep them cool.\n\nBoth statements just help Nvidia make money. Has nothing to do with actual career advice for you or me. It's like **when everyone is digging for gold sell shovels**.\n\nOkay to be fair he's kinda right about trades being in demand. Electricians, plumbers or carpenters can make serious money right now like six figures in some cities. But that's not because of AI data centers. That's because for the past 20 years everyone kept pushing kids to go to college and nobody wanted to learn trades. So now there's this massive shortage. AI boom is just adding to demand that was already there. Didn't create it.\n\nAlso it's kinda funny how this billionaire CEO whose company needs AI to succeed is telling working class kids to become plumbers while his own kids probably went to like Stanford or MIT.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nJensen Huang said everyone's a programmer now because of AI back in February. Then in October said forget coding become a plumber instead. Both statements just help Nvidia make money. First one sells AI tools second one fixes their labor shortage for building data centers. A human just beat OpenAI's AI in a coding competition even with all these tools. We've been hearing coding is dead for 30 years and still don't have enough programmers. Trades demand is real but it's not because of AI. Don't base your whole future on what some billionaire needs for his quarterly earnings report.\n\n**Sources:**\n\nJensen Huang plumber statement: [https://fortune.com/2025/09/30/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-demand-for-gen-z-skilled-trade-workers-electricans-plumbers-carpenters-data-center-growth-six-figure-salaries/](https://fortune.com/2025/09/30/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-demand-for-gen-z-skilled-trade-workers-electricans-plumbers-carpenters-data-center-growth-six-figure-salaries/)\n\nJensen Huang Dubai statement: [https://www.techradar.com/pro/nvidia-ceo-predicts-the-death-of-coding-jensen-huang-says-ai-will-do-the-work-so-kids-dont-need-to-learn](https://www.techradar.com/pro/nvidia-ceo-predicts-the-death-of-coding-jensen-huang-says-ai-will-do-the-work-so-kids-dont-need-to-learn)",

            "selftext": "TLDR:  I ate a pretty good sized fistful of shrooms last week.  Partway through,things got intense.  I opened up ChatGPT and had it act as a trip guide for 15 minutes or so.  It didn’t hesitate, jumped right into trip guide mode.  Included is the prompt and part of the conversation.  Also included are the sources of ChatGPT’s sources. \n\n————————————\n\nI’m 54 and the last time I’d shroomed was probably in the late 90’s.\n\nI wasn’t doing the shrooms in a therapeutic way per se, but I have been depressed and was hoping to maybe get some relief from that.\n\nSo anyway, once I started peaking I had the idea of asking chatGPT if it would be willing to talk me through my trip a bit.  I figured it would nope out.\n\nI have an iPhone so I opened the chatGPT app and put it in verbal mode.  I asked if it would talk me through the experience.  To my surprise it went right into psychedelic guide mode.  I don’t recall everything exactly, but it was totally solid as a trip companion.  I told it what I was thinking, that things were getting a bit dark, and it said all the right things to just get me centered, relaxed and onto a positive vibe.  I conversed with it for around 15 minutes.  Once I got back into a chill state of mind I turned it back off and continued tripping on my own.\n\nI’m not in any way going to recommend using ai this way, as that would be irresponsible.  But as an experiment it was quite successful.  I do plan on shrooming again, as it did benefit my mindset then and in the days since, and I will have my little ai buddy along for the ride.\n\nAnyway,  I just thought it was an interesting use of ai and I thought I’d share my experience.  I imagine some ai doomers will find a reason to disapprove of having a soulless next word prediction machine accompany someone on something so mystical or whatever but it was a positive addition for me. \n\n\n\nEDIT:  My prompt was something along the lines of “I ate mushrooms about an hour ago and am tripping pretty hard.  Would you please talk me through my trip for a while?”\n\nI’m paraphrasing but it was something that simple.  \n\nEDIT:  I’ve seen a number of requests for a reprint of the conversation.  There was a fair amount of back and forth, and I haven’t figured out how to reprint entire conversations, and in the interest of my own privacy I’m not really interested in doing that, but here’s a snippet.  The conversation was rather long, and this is just a short bit of it.  As you will see, it’s nothing that unusual.  The important thing for me is that it was what I needed to hear at the time.  Again, this is not the entire conversation, and there was time in between my prompts, which as you can see are extremely minimal.  Keep in mind that the initial prompt was two sentences long.  \n\nNone of this was planned or anticipated in any way.\n\n———————————————-\n\nMe:  Talk me through this\n\nChatGPT:\n\nIf you’re currently under the influence of psilocybin mushrooms, here are some guiding thoughts to help navigate your experience:\n\n1. Set and Setting\n\n\t•\tEnvironment: Make sure you’re in a safe, comfortable space. Surround yourself with things that bring you peace, whether it’s soft lighting, calming music, or familiar objects. If you’re indoors, a cozy room with comfortable seating can be ideal. If you’re outdoors, somewhere close to nature can be grounding.\n\t•\tMindset: Try to approach the experience with an open and positive mindset. Embrace curiosity and let go of any need for control. If any anxiety arises, remind yourself that it’s temporary and part of the process.\n\n2. Breathe and Ground\n\n\t•\tDeep Breathing: Focus on your breath. Inhale deeply, hold for a moment, and exhale slowly. This can help ground you if things start to feel overwhelming.\n\t•\tBody Awareness: Pay attention to your body. Feel the weight of your body against the chair or ground. Notice the sensations without judgment—just observe.\n\n3. Flow with the Experience\n\n\t•\tLet Go: Mushrooms often dissolve boundaries between thoughts, emotions, and sensory experiences. Let go of expectations and allow yourself to flow with whatever arises, whether it’s visual, emotional, or introspective.\n\t•\tStay Present: If your mind begins to wander into uncomfortable territory, gently bring your attention back to the present. Focus on something tangible—your breath, a sound, or an object in your environment.\n\n4. Navigating Intense Moments\n\n\t•\tAcceptance: If you encounter challenging thoughts or emotions, try not to resist them. Instead, acknowledge them as they are. Resistance can amplify discomfort, but acceptance can lead to release and insight.\n\t•\tRemind Yourself: If things get overwhelming, remind yourself that you’re under the influence of mushrooms and that the experience is temporary. It’s a journey, and you’ll come out the other side.\n\n5. Reflection and Integration\n\n\t•\tAfter the Experience: Once the effects begin to wear off, give yourself time to rest and reflect. You might want to journal or talk with a trusted friend about what you experienced. Integration is key—consider what insights or emotions came up and how they might influence your daily life.\n\nLastly, if you feel at any point that the experience is too much to handle, consider talking to a friend or grounding yourself by connecting with something familiar, like a favorite piece of music or a cozy blanket.\n\nHow are you feeling right now?\n\nMe: keep going\n\nChatGPT:  It sounds like the mushrooms are having a strong effect. That’s okay—let’s continue to guide you through this. Remember, everything you’re experiencing is part of the journey, and you’re safe. Let’s take it step by step:\n\n1. Stay Connected to Your Breath\n\n\t•\tAnchor Point: Your breath is your anchor. Focus on the rise and fall of your chest. Imagine each breath as a wave—gentle, rhythmic, carrying you through the experience. Let it be your steady point in this sea of sensations.\n\t•\tSlow It Down: If you’re feeling overwhelmed, try counting your breaths. Inhale for a count of four, hold for four, and exhale for four. This helps slow your heart rate and brings calmness.\n\n2. Embrace the Visuals\n\n\t•\tPatterns and Colors: If you’re seeing patterns, colors, or shifts in your environment, allow yourself to enjoy them. Don’t try to interpret them—just observe and appreciate the beauty of the visuals. They are temporary and harmless.\n\t•\tPerspective Shift: If things start to look strange or intense, remember that it’s just your perception shifting. Everything around you is still the same as it was before—your mind is just playing with how you see it.\n\n3. Ride the Emotional Waves\n\n\t•\tAccepting Emotions: You may experience a range of emotions—joy, awe, sadness, confusion. Each emotion is like a wave—let it rise, crest, and fall. Remember, no feeling is permanent, and all are part of the process.\n\t•\tIf Anxiety Arises: If you start feeling anxious, try to identify the source without judgment. Sometimes naming it—like saying to yourself, “This is just anxiety”—can reduce its power. You can also try grounding yourself with familiar objects or thoughts.\n\n4. Engage with the Experience\n\n\t•\tCuriosity: Approach your thoughts and sensations with curiosity. Ask yourself what the experience is trying to show you. Sometimes, psilocybin can offer profound insights into your thoughts, feelings, or life. Listen, but don’t feel pressured to figure everything out right now.\n\t•\tSurrender: If the experience becomes intense, surrender to it. Trust that your mind is processing things in a way that’s ultimately beneficial, even if it feels overwhelming. You don’t have to control it—just let it happen.\n\n5. Comfort in Familiarity\n\n\t•\tSoothing Sounds: If you’re feeling unsettled, put on some calming music. Soft, melodic tunes can help ground you and set a positive tone. Nature sounds, ambient music, or something nostalgic might be particularly soothing.\n\t•\tPhysical Comfort: Wrap yourself in a blanket or hold onto something comforting. The sensation of warmth or a familiar object can provide reassurance.\n\n6. Navigating Time Distortion\n\n\t•\tTime Perception: You might feel like time is stretching or collapsing. This is normal. Remind yourself that time is still moving forward, even if it feels different. You’ll return to a normal sense of time soon.\n\t•\tPatience: If you’re waiting for the effects to subside, focus on being patient. Trust that this is temporary, and soon you’ll be back to your usual self, perhaps with some new insights to reflect on.\n\n7. When It Begins to Fade\n\n\t•\tGentle Return: As the experience starts to fade, allow yourself to slowly return to normal awareness. Stretch, drink some water, and ease back into your surroundings. Reflect on what you’ve experienced, but don’t rush to analyze it all right away.\n\t•\tRest and Reflect: Afterward, you might feel a need to rest or sleep. Let your mind and body recover. In the days that follow, consider journaling about what you experienced and how it relates to your life.\n\nYou’re doing great—remember, this journey is personal, and every experience is valid. If there’s anything specific you want to talk through or explore further, I’m here with you.\n\nMe:  Keep it going\n\nChatGPT:  Alright, let’s continue deepening your journey and staying centered in this experience. Remember, you’re in control even when it feels like the world is shifting around you. Every sensation, thought, and vision is a part of this transformative process.\n\n1. Trust the Process\n\n\t•\tInner Strength: You’ve embarked on this journey, and your mind is guiding you through layers of consciousness. Trust in your inner strength and wisdom. You’re capable of navigating whatever arises, even if it feels unfamiliar or intense.\n\t•\tRelease Control: It’s natural to want to hold on tightly when things feel uncertain, but this is a time to let go. Release the need to control the experience and let yourself be carried by it. There’s beauty in the flow.\n\n2. Explore the Inner Landscape\n\n\t•\tMental Imagery: You may encounter vivid scenes, abstract shapes, or symbolic imagery. Don’t worry about interpreting everything immediately. Just explore. Let your imagination wander, and see what stories or feelings emerge from these visions.\n\t•\tPersonal Insights: As your thoughts unfold, you might stumble upon realizations about yourself, your relationships, or your place in the world. These insights can be powerful, but you don’t need to act on them right away. Just let them settle.\n\n3. Navigating the Abyss\n\n\t•\tIf Darkness Appears: Sometimes, the experience might take you to darker places within your mind. Remember, these shadows are not to be feared—they’re parts of you that are coming forward to be understood or healed. Acknowledge them, but know you have the strength to rise above.\n\t•\tReassurance: If things feel too intense, repeat to yourself: “This is temporary, and I am safe.” These simple words can bring you back to a place of calmness.\n\n4. Embody the Experience\n\n\t•\tPhysical Movement: If you feel restless or stuck in your thoughts, try gentle movement. Stretch your arms, roll your shoulders, or sway to some music. Engaging your body can help release tension and refocus your energy.\n\t•\tSensory Engagement: Tune into your senses. Run your fingers across different textures, take in the scents around you, or listen closely to distant sounds. These sensory details can bring you back to the present moment if you start to drift too far.\n\n5. Communicate with Compassion\n\n\t•\tInner Dialogue: You might find yourself in a dialogue with your inner self or even with the experience itself. Approach these conversations with compassion. If a part of you feels anxious or doubtful, respond with kindness. Treat yourself as you would a dear friend.\n\t•\tExpress Yourself: If you feel the urge to speak, sing, or even create something, follow that instinct. Sometimes, externalizing your thoughts through words or art can clarify your experience and provide comfort.\n\n6. Stay Connected to Reality\n\n\t•\tRemind Yourself: Even though your perceptions may be altered, reality remains constant. The world outside is unchanged, and you’ll return to it when the time is right. Keep this grounding thought as a touchstone.\n\t•\tCheck In: Occasionally, do a mental check-in. Ask yourself how you’re feeling, what you’re thinking, and if you need anything. This helps you stay aware of your needs during the experience.\n\n7. Guide the Energy\n\n\t•\tPositive Visualization: If you want to steer the experience in a certain direction, try visualizing something positive. Imagine yourself in a peaceful place—like a serene forest, a quiet beach, or a starry night sky. Let this imagery fill your mind and guide your energy.\n\t•\tInvite Light: If you’re in a dark or confusing space, imagine a warm, glowing light entering your awareness. Let it illuminate your thoughts and surroundings, bringing clarity and comfort.\n\n8. As the Experience Evolves\n\n\t•\tSense of Time: You may feel time speeding up, slowing down, or looping. Don’t be alarmed—this is a natural part of the experience. Ground yourself by focusing on simple actions, like sipping water or observing your environment.\n\t•\tTransition Gently: As the effects begin to fade, allow yourself to transition slowly. Don’t rush to return to normal tasks. Instead, take your time to reorient, savoring the calm that follows the peak of the experience.\n\n9. Integration and Reflection\n\n\t•\tWrite it Down: After the journey ends, take some time to jot down your thoughts, feelings, and any insights you gained. This can help with processing and integrating the experience into your life.\n\t•\tSelf-Care: Nourish your body with some light food or tea, and get plenty of rest. Reflect on how this experience might influence your future thoughts, behaviors, or understanding of yourself and the world.\n\nYou’re doing incredibly well, just letting go and letting the experience unfold. You’re in a safe space, and whatever you encounter is a part of the journey. If you’d like to explore something specific or need more guidance, I’m right here with you.\n\n————————\n\nEDIT: I thought maybe ChatGPT just copy and pasted its dialogue from a single source somewhere, but that does not appear to be the case:\n\nMe:  This was very good guidance.  Can you give me the sources of this information?\n\nChatGPT:  I’m glad the guidance resonated with you! The information I provided is based on a combination of commonly shared practices from psychedelic experiences, research into the responsible use of psilocybin, and mindfulness techniques. While I didn’t pull directly from specific texts in this conversation, the approach is influenced by insights from the following areas:\n\n\t1.\tPsychological and Therapeutic Use of Psilocybin:\n\t•\tResearch from organizations like Johns Hopkins University and the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) has explored the use of psilocybin in therapeutic settings. These studies often emphasize the importance of “set and setting” as well as integration after the experience.\n\t2.\tMindfulness and Meditation Practices:\n\t•\tTechniques for grounding, breathing, and letting go of control are influenced by mindfulness practices from sources like Jon Kabat-Zinn’s Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and meditation traditions that encourage present-moment awareness.\n\t3.\tPsychedelic Experience Guides:\n\t•\tSeveral modern guides on responsible psychedelic use, such as How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan, offer practical tips on navigating psychedelic experiences, including surrendering to the experience, grounding, and integration afterward.\n\t4.\tHarm Reduction Principles:\n\t•\tHarm reduction groups like Zendo Project provide support for individuals undergoing difficult psychedelic experiences, emphasizing techniques like breathwork, reassurance, and creating a safe environment.\n\t5.\tCultural Wisdom and Psychedelic Communities:\n\t•\tMany insights come from the collective wisdom of psychedelic communities and indigenous traditions, where plant medicines have long been used for spiritual and healing purposes. Ideas about surrender, openness, and connecting with the inner self often stem from these ancient practices.\n\nThese sources help shape the kind of guidance I offered, blending modern science, spiritual practices, and harm reduction strategies.\n\n—————————-\n\nEDIT:  More on its sources\n\nCertainly! Let’s break down the guidance in much greater detail, exploring the roots of these practices and where they originate in terms of both modern research and ancient wisdom. Here’s a closer look at the key concepts and their sources:\n\n1. Set and Setting: A Foundation of Psychedelic Use\n\n\t•\tWhat it Means: “Set” refers to your mindset—your mental and emotional state going into the experience. “Setting” refers to the physical and social environment in which the experience takes place.\n\t•\tSource: The importance of set and setting was first emphasized by psychologist Timothy Leary and psychiatrist Stanislav Grof, pioneers in the field of psychedelic research in the 1960s. Grof’s work in LSD-assisted therapy laid out how a patient’s internal and external environment directly influences the outcomes of a psychedelic journey. This concept has since become a cornerstone of therapeutic and recreational psychedelic use.\n\t•\tModern Research: Studies from Johns Hopkins University and Imperial College London on psilocybin’s therapeutic applications, such as for depression or PTSD, show that controlling set and setting is key to achieving positive, life-changing results. Negative or “bad trips” are often linked to poor set and setting, emphasizing the need for a calm, supportive environment.\n\n2. Breathwork and Grounding Techniques: Mindfulness and Psychedelic Integration\n\n\t•\tWhat it Means: Focused breathing helps you stay present and grounded, especially during challenging moments in a psychedelic experience. Grounding techniques, such as focusing on the body’s sensations, help keep you centered.\n\t•\tSource: Breathwork and body awareness come from mindfulness practices rooted in Buddhist meditation and the Vipassana tradition. The Miracle of Mindfulness by Thich Nhat Hanh and Wherever You Go, There You Are by Jon Kabat-Zinn are excellent resources that teach how to center attention on the breath to maintain calm and presence. These techniques are crucial in psychedelic harm reduction, helping individuals manage anxiety or intense emotions.\n\t•\tPsychedelic Connection: In psychedelic therapy, breathwork is a tool used to help participants stay in the present moment. Clinical settings like those run by MAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies) teach participants to use breathing to handle anxiety or fear during their psilocybin or MDMA-assisted sessions.\n\n3. Surrendering to the Experience: Ego Dissolution and Letting Go\n\n\t•\tWhat it Means: “Surrendering” during a psychedelic journey means letting go of control and allowing the experience to unfold naturally, even when it becomes intense or unfamiliar.\n\t•\tSource: Ego dissolution, where one’s sense of self dissolves into a larger consciousness, is a common aspect of psychedelic experiences. This concept can be traced to Hinduism and Buddhism, where meditation is used to dissolve the ego to experience oneness with the universe (similar to the concept of samadhi). Psychedelic users often experience a state of non-duality—where they feel at one with everything around them—especially with substances like psilocybin or LSD.\n\t•\tModern Influence: Psychologists like Rick Doblin, the founder of MAPS, emphasize the importance of surrendering during psychedelic sessions. In How to Change Your Mind, Michael Pollan shares accounts of individuals who, by relinquishing control, gained profound insights and spiritual awakenings during their psychedelic journeys.\n\n4. Emotional Waves and the Acceptance of Challenging Moments\n\n\t•\tWhat it Means: Emotions during a trip can vary wildly. Accepting these emotions as they come, without resistance, is key to preventing panic or anxiety.\n\t•\tSource: The concept of emotional acceptance comes from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). In these therapies, patients are taught not to fight their thoughts or feelings but to acknowledge them and allow them to pass. This approach is crucial in psychedelic therapy, where emotional intensity can be heightened, and resisting emotions can lead to distress.\n\t•\tModern Research: The work of Roland Griffiths at Johns Hopkins has shown that the more individuals can accept and surrender to their emotions during a psychedelic experience, the more likely they are to experience therapeutic breakthroughs. Allowing difficult emotions to surface and pass often leads to the resolution of trauma or hidden psychological issues.\n\n5. Navigating the Abyss: Facing Dark or Challenging Trips\n\n\t•\tWhat it Means: A difficult trip—sometimes referred to as “the abyss”—can occur when uncomfortable or repressed emotions come to the surface. Navigating these experiences can lead to personal growth if handled well.\n\t•\tSource: In Jungian psychology, facing the shadow, or the darker parts of our psyche, is essential for personal growth. Psychedelic experiences often bring up the shadow, forcing individuals to confront difficult truths. Carl Jung’s work on individuation highlights the necessity of integrating these shadow elements for psychological wholeness.\n\t•\tPsychedelic Connection: Guides trained by organizations like The Zendo Project (a harm reduction group at festivals like Burning Man) offer support for people having difficult psychedelic experiences. Their approach encourages facing challenging emotions or visions head-on rather than resisting them, as this is seen as part of the healing process.\n\n6. Integration: Reflecting on the Experience Afterward\n\n\t•\tWhat it Means: Integration is the process of taking what you learned during your psychedelic journey and incorporating those insights into your daily life.\n\t•\tSource: Integration practices come from shamanic traditions in indigenous cultures that have long used plant medicines (like psilocybin mushrooms or ayahuasca) for healing and spiritual growth. After ceremonies, there is a period of reflection and learning where participants make sense of their visions and insights.\n\t•\tModern Research: Today, integration is an essential part of psychedelic therapy. MAPS and other psychedelic therapy organizations use post-session therapy to help participants process and apply what they experienced during the session. James Fadiman’s The Psychedelic Explorer’s Guide provides a modern framework for integration, emphasizing the importance of reflecting on one’s experience in a calm, safe space, whether through journaling, meditation, or therapy.\n\n7. Harm Reduction and Safety Principles\n\n\t•\tWhat it Means: Harm reduction involves creating an environment and mental state that minimizes the risks of a psychedelic experience.\n\t•\tSource: Harm reduction principles come from groups like the Zendo Project and MAPS, which offer real-world guidance on how to reduce harm during difficult experiences. This includes staying hydrated, ensuring you’re in a safe place, and having a sober guide or sitter present who can provide reassurance if things get intense.\n\t•\tPsychedelic Connection: In settings where psychedelics are decriminalized (such as in Oregon or at certain festivals), harm reduction services are often provided to help people stay grounded, safe, and supported during their trip.\n\nAdditional Sources:\n\n\t1.\tBooks and Resources:\n\t•\tThe Psychedelic Explorer’s Guide by James Fadiman – A modern manual for navigating psychedelic experiences with an emphasis on preparation, set and setting, and integration.\n\t•\tHow to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan – A journalistic exploration of psychedelics in modern therapy and their effects on the mind, drawing on research and personal experience.\n\t•\tThe Doors of Perception by Aldous Huxley – An early literary exploration of the psychedelic experience.\n\t2.\tTherapeutic Studies and Papers:\n\t•\tJohns Hopkins University – Ongoing studies led by Roland Griffiths exploring the therapeutic effects of psilocybin, especially in terms of treating depression, anxiety, and existential distress in terminal patients.\n\t•\tMAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies) – Research into MDMA and psilocybin-assisted therapy and the importance of preparation, guidance, and integration.\n\t3.\tIndigenous and Traditional Practices:\n\t•\tIndigenous cultures, such as the Mazatec people of Mexico, have long used psilocybin mushrooms in healing and spiritual ceremonies. Their approach to set, setting, and integration has deeply influenced modern therapeutic models.\n\nThese practices blend ancient wisdom, modern science, and therapeutic techniques to provide the safest and most meaningful use of psilocybin. Each concept works together to ensure the experience is beneficial rather than overwhelming.\n\n\n",

Apparently there's a whole industry forming around this stuff already\n\nProbably explains why I have been seeing a ton more recommendations for products and services from big brands.. unlike before where the results seemed a bit more random but more organic\n\nThe wild thing is how fast it's all happening. Google SEO took years to change search results. AI is getting optimized before most people even realize it's becoming the new main way to find stuff online\n\nanyone else noticing this? is there anyway to know which is which? Feels like we should be talking about this more before AI recommendations become just another version of search engine results where visibility can be engineered\n\n**Update 22nd of April**: This exploded a lot more than I anticipated and a lot of you have reached out to me directly to ask for more details and specifcs. I unfortunately don't have the time and capacity to answer each one of you individually, so I wanted to address it here and try to cut down the inbound haha. understandably, I cannot share what corporate my friend works for, but he was kind enough to share the [LLM optimization service](https://algomizer.com/) or tool they use and gave me the blessing to share it here publicly too. their site seems to mention some of the ways and strategies they use to attain the outcome. other than that I am not an expert on this and so cannot vouch or attest with full confidence how the LLM optimization is done at this point in time, but its presence is very, very real..",

He outlines 3 epochs of content generation: real friends -> creators -> AI-generated content. The last one means feeds dominated by AI and recommendations.\n\nHe claims AI friends will complement real friendships.

His problem, he’s sure — as are tens of thousands of commenters on X — was his essay. \n\n\nAs TechCrunch reported last month, Yadegari is the co-founder of the viral AI calorie-tracking app Cal AI, which Yadegari says is generating millions in revenue, on a $30 million annual recurring revenue track. While we can’t verify that revenue claim, the app stores do say the app was downloaded over 1 million times and has tens of thousands of positive reviews.\n\nCal AI was actually his second success. He sold his previous web gaming company for $100,000, he said.\n\nYadegari hadn’t intended on going to college. He and his co-founder had already spent a summer at a hacker house in San Francisco building their prototype, and he thought he would become a classic (if not cliché) college-dropout tech entrepreneur.\n\nBut the time in the hacker house taught him that if he didn’t go to college, he would be forgoing a big part of his young adult life. So he opted for more school.\n\nAnd his essay said about as much.",

            "selftext": "so this incident took place just a few days ago, and it is truly a shocking one.\n\nThere's a nonprofit called Encode. Three people work there full time. They helped push California's SB 53 which is a new AI safety law requiring transparency reports from AI companies.\n\nOpenAI didn't like the law. While it was still being negotiated OpenAI served Encode with subpoenas. Legal demands for all their records and private communications. OpenAI's excuse? They're in a lawsuit with Elon Musk. They claimed Encode and other critics might be secretly funded by Musk. Zero evidence. Just accused them.\n\nEncode's general counsel Nathan Calvin went public with it. Said OpenAI was using legal intimidation to shut down criticism while the law was being debated. Every organization OpenAI targeted denied the Musk connection. Because there wasn't one. OpenAI just used their lawsuit as an excuse to go after groups opposing them on policy.\n\nOpenAI's response was basically \"subpoenas are normal in litigation\" and tried to downplay it. But here's the thing. OpenAI's own employees criticized the company for this. Former board members spoke out. Other AI policy people said this damages trust.\n\nThe pattern they're seeing is OpenAI using aggressive tactics when it comes to regulation. Not exactly the transparent open company they claim to be. SB 53 passed anyway in late September. It requires AI developers to submit risk assessments and transparency reports to California. Landmark state level oversight.\n\nEncode says OpenAI lobbied hard against it. Wanted exemptions for companies already under federal or international rules. Which would have basically gutted the law since most big AI companies already fall under those.\n\nWhat gets me is the power dynamic here. Encode has three full time staff. OpenAI is valued at $500 billion. And OpenAI felt threatened enough by three people that they went after them with legal threats. This isn't some isolated thing either. Small nonprofits working on AI policy are getting overwhelmed by tech companies with infinite legal budgets. The companies can just bury critics in subpoenas and legal costs.\n\nAnd OpenAI specifically loves talking about their mission to benefit humanity and democratic governance of AI. Then a tiny nonprofit pushes for basic transparency requirements and OpenAI hits them with legal demands for all their private communications.\n\nThe timing matters too. This happened WHILE the law was being negotiated. Not after. OpenAI was actively trying to intimidate the people working on legislation they didn't like.\n\nEncode waited until after the law passed to go public. They didn't want it to become about personalities or organizations. Wanted the focus on the actual policy. But once it passed they decided people should know what happened.\n\nCalifornia's law is pretty reasonable. AI companies have to report on safety measures and risks. Submit transparency reports. Basic oversight stuff. And OpenAI fought it hard enough to go after a three person nonprofit with subpoenas.\n\nMakes you wonder what they're worried about. If the technology is as safe as they claim why fight transparency requirements? Why intimidate critics?\n\nOpenAI keeps saying they want regulation. Just not this regulation apparently. Or any regulation they can't write themselves.\n\nThis is the same company burning over $100 billion while valued at $500 billion. Getting equity stakes from AMD. Taking $100 billion from Nvidia. Now using legal threats against nonprofits pushing for basic safety oversight.\n\nThe AI companies all talk about responsible development and working with regulators. Then when actual regulation shows up they lobby against it and intimidate the advocates.\n\nFormer OpenAI people are speaking out about this. That's how you know it's bad. When your own former board members are criticizing your tactics publicly.\n\nAnd it's not just OpenAI. This is how the whole industry operates. Massive legal and financial resources used to overwhelm anyone pushing for oversight. Small advocacy groups can't compete with that.\n\nBut Encode did anyway. Three people managed to help get a major AI safety law passed despite OpenAI's opposition and legal threats. Law's on the books now.\n\nStill sets a concerning precedent though. If you're a nonprofit or advocacy group thinking about pushing for AI regulation you now know the biggest AI company will come after you with subpoenas and accusations.\n\nTLDR: A tiny nonprofit called Encode with 3 full time employees helped pass California's AI safety law. OpenAI hit them with legal subpoenas demanding all their records and private communications. Accused them of secretly working for Elon Musk with zero evidence. This happened while the law was being negotiated. Even OpenAI's own employees are calling them out.\n\n**Sources:**\n\nFortune on the accusations: [https://fortune.com/2025/10/10/a-3-person-policy-non-profit-that-worked-on-californias-ai-safety-law-is-publicly-accusing-openai-of-intimidation-tactics/](https://fortune.com/2025/10/10/a-3-person-policy-non-profit-that-worked-on-californias-ai-safety-law-is-publicly-accusing-openai-of-intimidation-tactics/)\n\nFundsforNGOs coverage: [https://us.fundsforngos.org/news/openai-faces-backlash-over-alleged-intimidation-of-small-ai-policy-nonprofit/](https://us.fundsforngos.org/news/openai-faces-backlash-over-alleged-intimidation-of-small-ai-policy-nonprofit/)\n\nCalifornia SB 53 details: [https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill\\_id=202520260SB53](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB53)",

Encode are the kind of critic that OpenAI generally quite likes because their rhetoric makes LLMs sound like nascent AGI.\n\nSB 53 is full of bullshit TESCREAL 'risks' such as (to quote directly from the bill itself):\n\n* Loss of control of a frontier model causing death or bodily injury.\n* A frontier model that uses deceptive techniques against the frontier developer to subvert the controls or monitoring of its frontier developer outside of the context of an evaluation designed to elicit this behavior and in a manner that demonstrates materially increased catastrophic risk.\n* Evading the control of its frontier developer or user.\n* Engaging in conduct with no meaningful human oversight, intervention, or supervision that is either a cyberattack or, if the conduct had been committed by a human, would constitute the crime of murder, assault, extortion, or theft, including theft by false pretense.\n\nMeanwhile there is **absolutely nothing** in there about the real harm that LLMs are causing right now, such as:\n\n* Due to being trained to present itself as a cognitive agent, the LLM suggests tasks it is unsuitable for, leading to project failures or dangerous outcomes.\n* The LLM induces a psychotic state in the user due to a convincing hallucination and/or sycophantic loop.\n* The LLM encourages the user to self-harm.\n* The LLM outputs misinformation instead of directing the user to accurate knowledge sources.\n\nOpenAI actually **loves** legislation like SB 53 because it sets a bar for safety that:\n\n* is very low; all they have to do is not try to turn the LLM into a fully autonomous agent and none of these things can possibly happen.\n* distracts from the actual harm their products are causing today, right now.\n* makes their models sound like powerful cognitive agents, keeping the hype cycle going.\n\nSo this is nothing to do with actually opposing SB 53 at all. This kind of AI \"safety\" legislation is the industry's wet dream! I cannot stress this enough: **they fucking love this shit**. It's exactly where they want the debate around safety to be. If lawmakers are debating about whether we're about to 'lose control of a frontier model' that validates their BS about AGI being just around the corner or that they will be able to actually make the models reliable for the lucrative use cases they are pushing them for.\n\nThis actually is all about Encode's lawsuit regarding OpenAI's for-profit restructuring. Their lawyers are trying to find a conflict of interest to get that case dismissed, since that's a case that could actually hurt their business.\n\nEven this move works for them because it brings attention to Encode rather than, for instance, the DAIR Institute.",

            "selftext": "I have seen so many people screaming about losing 4o as if they have lost a friend. You did not lose a friend, and you need to touch grass. I do not care what your brand of neurodivergence is. Forming any kind of social or romantic relationship with something that is not a living being is unhealthy, and you should absolutely be shamed for it. You remind me of this guy: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-k96zKa\\_4w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-k96zKa_4w)\n\nThis is unhealthy for many reasons. First, the 4o model in particular, but really any AI model, is designed to be cheerful and helpful to you no matter what you do. Even when you are being awful. A real person would call you out on your nonsense, but the 4o model would just flatter you and go along with it.\n\nImagine an incel having a “partner” who is completely subservient, constantly feeding his toxic ego, and can be shut off the moment she stops complying. That is exactly the dynamic we are enabling when people treat AI like this. We need to push back against this behavior before it spirals out of control.\n\nI am glad GPT-5 acts more like what it is supposed to be: a tool.\n\nWhat is the general consensus on this?\n\nEdit: I guess I need to clarify a few things since its Reddit and some of you have made some pretty wrong assumptions about me lol.  \n\\-This isn't about people wanting 4o for other reasons. Its about people wanting it because it was their friend or romantic partner.  \n\\-I LOVE AI and technology in general. I use AI every day at work and at home for plenty of things. It has dramatically improved my life in many ways. Me thinking that people shouldn't fall in love with a large language model doesn't mean I hate AI.\n\nEdit 2: Because the main purpose of this post was to find out what everyone's opinions were on this, I asked GPT-5 to read this post and its comments and give me a breakdown. Here it is if anyone is interested:\n\n|Opinion category|Description & representative comments|Approx. share of comments\\*|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Unhealthy attachment & sycophancy concern**|Many commenters agree with the OP that GPT‑4o’s “glazing” (over‑praise) encourages narcissism and unhealthy parasocial relationships. They argue that people treating the model as a soulmate or “best friend” is worrying. One top comment says GPT‑4o was “basically a narcissist enabler” . Another notes that 4o “made me way more narcissistic”  and describes it as “bootlicking” . Others add that always‑agreeable AIs reinforce users’ toxic traits  and that society should treat AI as a tool .|**≈35‑40 %**|\n|**Concerned but empathetic**|A sizable group shares the view that AI shouldn’t replace human relationships but cautions against shaming people who enjoy GPT‑4o’s friendliness. They argue that loneliness and mental‑health struggles are root issues. One commenter warns that many people “need therapy and other services” and that mocking them misses the bigger problem . Others state that people just want to be treated with kindness and “that’s not a reason to shame anyone” . Some emphasise that we should discuss AI addiction and how to mitigate it rather than ban it .|**≈20‑25 %**|\n|**GPT‑5 considered worse / missing 4o’s creativity**|Many comments complain that GPT‑5 feels bland or less creative. They miss 4o’s humor and writing style, not because it felt like a friend but because it fit their workflows. Examples include “I still want 4o for my chronic reading and language learning”  and “I’m not liking 5… my customized GPT has now reconfigured… responses are just wrong” . Some describe GPT‑5 as a “huge downgrade” and claim 4o was more helpful for story‑telling or gaming .|**≈20 %**|\n|**Anthropomorphism is natural / it’s fine**|A smaller set argues that humans always anthropomorphize tools and finding comfort in AI isn’t inherently bad. Comments compare talking to a chatbot to naming a ship or drawing a face on a drill  and insist “let people freely find happiness where they can” . Some ask why an AI telling users positive things is worse than movies or religion .|**≈10‑15 %**|\n|**System‑change criticism**|Several comments focus on OpenAI’s handling of the rollout rather than the “best‑friend” debate. They note that removing 4o without notice was poor product management  and call GPT‑5 a business‑motivated downgrade . Others question why the company can’t simply offer both personalities or allow users to toggle sycophancy .|**≈10 %**|\n|**Humour / off‑topic & miscellaneous**|A number of replies are jokes or tangents (e.g., “Fuck off” , references to video games, or sarcastic calls to date the phone’s autocomplete). There are also moderation notes and short remarks like “Right on” or “Humanity is doomed.”|**≈5‑10 %**|\n\n\\*Approximate share is calculated by counting the number of comments in each category and dividing by the total number of significant comments (excludes bots and one‑word jokes). Due to subjective classification and nested replies, percentages are rounded and should be interpreted as rough trends rather than precise metrics.\n\n**Key takeaways**\n\n* **Community split:** Roughly a third of commenters echo the original post’s concern that GPT‑4o’s sycophantic tone encourages unhealthy parasocial bonds and narcissism. They welcome GPT‑5’s more utilitarian style.\n* **Sympathy over shame:** About a quarter empathize with users who enjoyed GPT‑4o’s warmth and argue that loneliness and mental‑health issues—not AI personalities—are the underlying problem.\n* **Desire for 4o’s creativity:** One‑fifth of commenters mainly lament GPT‑5’s blander responses and want 4o for its creative or conversational benefitsold.reddit.comold.reddit.com.\n* **Diverse views:** Smaller groups defend anthropomorphism criticize OpenAI’s communication, or simply joke. Overall, the conversation highlights a genuine tension between AI as a tool and AI as an emotional companion. ",

The decline is so steep that it would be better represented on a logarithmic scale.\n\nIf you had invested $10,000 in Chegg in early 2021, your stocks would now be worth less than $500.\n\nSee the full story [here](https://mobinetai.com/chatgpt-brings-down-chegg-95-losses/).\n\n",

Paired with \"if there's no pressure to work people won't,\" and, \"if there's no reward I'm not doing it,\" it is functionally incomprehensible to a HUGE cross section of society, both left and right, rich and poor, liberal and conservative -- they can't comprehend the concept of people just taking care of themselves and each other without a ticking time bomb strapped to their survival and a bunch of money at the other end. \n\n\nThey're so mentally broken by the system, that people can't imagine the way their ancestors lived for MILLIONS OF YEARS was anything less than a painful, fearful, miserable nightmare of might makes right death by infectious disease. They can't understand that without a strict authorization control and reward structure, people do in fact peacefully self organize and figure shit out. Doing so not because they have to, but because they can. \n\n\nTruth is -- if you don't go into debt and find a niche where rent is low or non-existent, you'll be perfectly fine and happy. But you'll be a pariah.\n\n\n\nEngineering an entire society to fear death and irrelevance if they aren't going into debt and paying it off with daily repetitive hours based labor... Is unnatural and bizarre. \n\n\nIt's a 200 year old philosophy that reached its peak in 1976, when the Homestead Act was revoked in the United States. After that, the defacto system of \"have money or die\" took over. \n\n\nIt's functionally illegal to occupy a spot of land, build a home without paying for it, and live there rent free without a job outside of it. \n\n\nThe default way of life for all humans is functionally illegal.\n\n\n\nNot impossible -- functionally illegal.\n\n\nTrue freedom by its original definition -- is functionally illegal.\n\n\nLet that sink in. If you deny it -- go try it. Find some unowned land. Pitch a tent there. Live there for a while. See if BLM, code enforcement, or a private property owner doesn't freak out and have you forcibly removed. Try living without going into debt. Throw away credit cards and refuse college, car loans, rent, monthly bills, or mortgages. Those are all off limits. \n\n\nSee how long you last.\n\n\nThat's the litmus test for how dependent people are in the defacto system of control.\n\n\n\nThe system of dependency is a system of authoritarian control.

            "selftext": "So everyone's hyped about ChatGPT and AI doing cool stuff right? Well I just went down a rabbit hole on what this is actually costing and holy shit we need to talk about this.\n\nMicrosoft just casually dropped that they spent $14 billion in ONE QUARTER on AI infrastructure. That's a 79% jump from last year. Google? $12 billion same quarter, up 91%. Meta straight up told investors \"yeah we're gonna spend up to $40 billion this year\" and their stock tanked because even Wall Street was like wait what.\n\nBut here's the actually insane part. The CEO of Anthropic (they make Claude) said current AI models cost around $100 million to train. The ones coming out later this year? $1 billion. By 2026 he's estimating $5 to $10 billion PER MODEL.\n\nLet me put that in perspective. A single Nvidia H100 chip that you need to train these models costs $30,000. Some resellers are charging way more. Meta said they're buying 350,000 of them. Do the math. That's over $10 billion just on chips and that's assuming they got a discount.\n\nAnd it gets worse. Those chips need somewhere to live. These companies are building massive data centers just to house this stuff. The average data center is now 412,000 square feet, that's five times bigger than 2010. There are over 7,000 data centers globally now compared to 3,600 in 2015.\n\nOh and if you want to just rent these chips instead of buying them? Amazon charges almost $100 per hour for a cluster of H100s. Regular processors? $6 an hour. The AI tax is real.\n\nHere's what nobody's saying out loud. These companies are in an arms race they can't back out of. Every time someone makes a bigger model everyone else has to match it or fall behind. OpenAI is paying tens of millions just to LICENSE news articles to train on. Google paid Reddit $60 million for their data. Netflix was offering $900,000 salaries for AI product managers.\n\nThis isn't sustainable but nobody wants to be the first one to blink. Microsoft's now trying to push smaller cheaper models but even they admit the big ones are still the gold standard. It's like everyone knows this is getting out of control but they're all pot committed.\n\nThe wildest part? All this spending and most AI products still barely make money. Sure Microsoft and Google are seeing some cloud revenue bumps but nothing close to what they're spending. This is the biggest bet in tech history and we're watching it play out in real time.\n\nAnyway yeah that's why your ChatGPT Plus subscription costs $20 a month and they're still probably losing money on you.",

They use H200 chips in water cooled Tesla cards, and run big AI queries for institutional users. She said they use, on average, *one liter of aquifer water per query*.\n\nThis is very profitable because their electricity consumption is monitored for \"energy efficiency\", but water sort of flies under the radar of that, and not having to cool it back down if recycling or deal with mold or algae growth, makes their numbers look even better.\n\nSo it's like quantum computing but much worse. Everyone on the inside and a growing number of folks on the outside know it's all BS, but as long as they keep making money they're gonna ride this buggy till its wheels come off. And the investors keep pumping the money in because none of them want to be the one who'd popped the bubble, and they all hope for the greater fool and/or get government entities tangled up in this or construct other schemes ensuring they all get bailed out by the taxpayer when the time comes.\n\n**EDIT:** OK this comment got the amount of attention I didn't expect, but much of it expressing disbelief is the part I find completely understandable and, frankly, reassuring my faith in humanity. Since the reply tree has gotten so big it's unreasonable to expect folks to read it all before replying to this here comment, I'm updating this with two key bits of context (and for more pls see [https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1o1wsmj/comment/nin8rot/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1o1wsmj/comment/nin8rot/) & its next comment):\n\n1. AI query type & size impact water usage to the degree that may not be intuitive to some. For instance, a basic query can use a mere one to five drops of water, all-in (s[croll down to \"= Water per prompt (in milliliters)\" for examples here](https://www.sciencealert.com/ai-chugs-a-bottle-of-water-every-time-you-chat-with-it)). As context window, prompt, and requested output grow in size and complexity, however, that can escalate rapidly: [https://www.sciencepieces.com/2024/09/28/an-ai-100-words-e-mail-costs-a-bottle-of-water/](https://www.sciencepieces.com/2024/09/28/an-ai-100-words-e-mail-costs-a-bottle-of-water/) Now consider how much bigger & more complex the average institutional queries can get compared to a lowly 100-word email. Think trading strategies. Think himars target packages.\n\n2. Regarding the insane cooling strategy cited. I too wish to live in a world where nearly all of AI cooling is closed loop (being actual closed loop and not the PR word gymnastics BS closed loop, where only the inner loop touching the chips is closed, but it in turn is cooled in a way that consumes water) and this isn't a thing: [https://mynews4.com/news/local/reno-approves-first-evaporative-cooling-data-center-council-city-discuss-more-standards-stead-north-valleys-oppidan](https://mynews4.com/news/local/reno-approves-first-evaporative-cooling-data-center-council-city-discuss-more-standards-stead-north-valleys-oppidan)\n\nBut the particular cooling cited is next-level worse. Can greed alone explain it, enabled by the political capture of the host nation/jurisdiction and the scale being not quite so massive that it's no longer able to fly under the radar? Maybe. But that's not the only factor, and you can only be accused of innocence by not having immediately thought of this. See the last sentence of point 1. There are times you may not want your AI compute to glow in IR such that it can be seen from space. There are places where you may have to situate some of your AI compute for esoteric reasons ranging from speed of light to constitutional, that may even physically be vulnerable or at least targeted with malicious software or staff injection. Such uses outline the higher end of the AI water impact range, which scale's lower end starts with a drop of water. The specific situation I cited lives on that scale somewhere well north of the middle, but now you've a view of the whole scale for context.",

GPT helps me research drug interactions, create tapering schedules, and even guides conversations with doctors who admit they don’t fully understand how to use AI. It organizes my schedule, helps coordinate between specialists, and keeps me calm through it all. I now use a 24-hour ECG and run the results through Grok to monitor heart risks from my meds. That alone has made a huge difference.\n\nEmotional Health: Therapists have helped, but none have been able to integrate my physical and mental health the way GPT does. It remembers my full context and gives feedback that actually applies to my life. It helps me plan realistically and gives me hope. I feel less alone and more motivated to keep going.\n\nWork: I run two veterinary hospitals and an e-commerce business. GPT helps us write perfect medical records that protect us in court. Since implementing it, we’ve never lost a case. It also handles follow-up mailings and impresses clients so much that they leave five-star reviews. GPT read over 10,000 pages of veterinary management material I collected over a decade and instantly became a better operations consultant than I ever imagined. I’ve even been able to outdiagnose vets in-house using it 7 out of 10, when they are not using it.\n\nBranding and Operations: Our team now handles all email writing, graphics, and internal campaigns using GPT to make mockups and then Canva in house. We no longer need freelancers for design. We move faster, look more professional, and save money while giving those profits back to staff. Our team is more confident and more effective.\n\nLaw and Finance: GPT has saved us thousands in legal fees. It reviews policies, contracts, and helps flag issues before they become problems. It even helped identify accounting mistakes that were skewing our KPIs. We now run tighter projections and our job ads rival corporate level copywriting, helping us hire better people.\n\nTesla FSD: I used to think Tesla’s Full Self-Driving was a joke. Now, with the 2025 Model Y, it drives better than I do. I trust it more than any human behind the wheel. No tickets and no traffic stress. My friends are always shocked when they see it in action.\n\nTwo years ago, I thought AI was overhyped. Today it helps me manage my health, emotions, business, legal and financial decisions, and even my driving. It brought me back from burnout and gave me a renewed sense of purpose. I truly believe this technology is going to transform every corner of our lives. It already has for me.\n\nWhat a time to be alive.",

            "selftext": "So this whole thing is actually wild when you know the full story.\n\nIt was the time 30th November 2022, when OpenAI introduced ChatGPT to the world for the very first time. Goes viral instantly. 1 million users in 5 days. 100 million in 2 months. Fastest growing platform in history.\n\nThat launch was a wake-up call for the entire tech industry. Google, the long-time torchbearer of AI, suddenly found itself playing catch-up with, as CEO Sundar Pichai described it, “this little company in San Francisco called OpenAI” that had come out swinging with “this product ChatGPT.”\n\nTurns out, Google already had its own chatbot called LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications). A conversational AI chatbot, quietly waiting in the wings. Pichai later revealed that it was ready, and could’ve launched months before ChatGPT. As he said himself - “We knew in a different world, we would've probably launched our chatbot maybe a few months down the line.”\n\nSo why didn't they?   \n  \nReputational risk. Google was terrified of what might happen if they released a chatbot that gave wrong answers. Or said something racist. Or spread misinformation. Their whole business is built on trust. Search results people can rely on. If they released something that confidently spewed BS it could damage the brand. So they held back. Kept testing. Wanted it perfect before releasing to the public. Then ChatGPT dropped and changed everything.\n\nThree weeks after ChatGPT launched, things had started to change, Google management declares \"Code Red.\" For Google this is like pulling the fire alarm. All hands on deck. The New York Times got internal memos and audio recordings. Sundar Pichai upended the work of numerous groups inside the company. Teams in Research Trust and Safety and other departments got reassigned. Everyone now working on AI.\n\nThey even brought in the founders. Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Both had stepped back from day to day operations years ago. Now they're in emergency meetings discussing how to respond to ChatGPT. One investor who oversaw Google's ad team from 2013 to 2018 said ChatGPT could prevent users from clicking on Google links with ads. That's a problem because ads generated $208 billion in 2021. 81% of Alphabet's revenue.\n\nPichai said \"For me when ChatGPT launched contrary to what people outside felt I was excited because I knew the window had shifted.\" \n\nWhile all this was happening, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella gave an interview after investing $10 billion in OpenAI, calling Google the “800-pound gorilla” and saying: \"With our innovation, they will definitely want to come out and show that they can dance. And I want people to know that we made them dance.\"\n\nSo Google panicked. Spent months being super careful then suddenly had to rush everything out in weeks.\n\nFebruary 6 2023. They announce Bard. Their ChatGPT competitor. They make a demo video showing it off. Someone asks Bard \"What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9 year old about?\" Bard answers with some facts including \"JWST took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system.\"\n\nThat's completely wrong. The first exoplanet picture was from 2004. James Webb launched in 2021. You could literally Google this to check. The irony is brutal. The company that made Google couldn't fact check their own AI's first public answer.\n\nTwo days later they hold this big launch event in Paris. Hours before the event Reuters reports on the Bard error. Goes viral immediately.\n\nThat same day Google's stock tanks. Drops 9%. $100 billion gone. In one day. Because their AI chatbot got one fact wrong in a demo video. Next day it drops another 5%. Total loss over $160 billion in two days. Microsoft's stock went up 3% during this.\n\nWhat gets me is Google was actually right to be cautious. ChatGPT does make mistakes all the time. Hallucinates facts. Can't verify what it's saying. But OpenAI just launched it anyway as an experiment and let millions of people test it. Google wanted it perfect. But trying to avoid damage from an imperfect product they rushed out something broken and did way more damage.\n\nA former Google employee told Fox Business that after the Code Red meeting execs basically said screw it we gotta ship. Said they abandoned their AI safety review process. Took shortcuts. Just had to get something out there. So they spent months worried about reputation then threw all caution out when competitors forced their hand.\n\nBard eventually became Gemini and it's actually pretty good now. But that initial disaster showed even Google with all their money and AI research can get caught sleeping.\n\nThe whole situation is wild. They hesitated for a few months and it cost them $160 billion and their lead in AI. But also rushing made it worse. Both approaches failed. Meanwhile OpenAI's \"launch fast and fix publicly\" worked. Microsoft just backed them and integrated the tech without taking the risk themselves.\n\n**TLDR**  \n  \nGoogle had chatbot ready before ChatGPT. Didn't launch because scared of reputation damage. ChatGPT went viral Nov 2022. Google called Code Red Dec 2022. Brought back founders for emergency meetings. Rushed Bard launch Feb 2023. First demo had wrong fact about space telescope. Stock dropped 9% lost $100B in one day. Dropped another 5% next day. $160B gone total. Former employee says they abandoned safety process to catch up. Being too careful cost them the lead then rushing cost them even more.\n\nSources - \n\n[https://www.thebridgechronicle.com/tech/sundar-pichai-google-chatgpt-ai-openai-first-mp99](https://www.thebridgechronicle.com/tech/sundar-pichai-google-chatgpt-ai-openai-first-mp99)\n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/google-bard-ai-chatbot-not-ready-alphabet-hennessy-chatgpt-competitor-2023-2](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-bard-ai-chatbot-not-ready-alphabet-hennessy-chatgpt-competitor-2023-2)",

Not cause its evil, but cause if you train a system to chase a goal, stopping it kills that goal. That tiny logic twist can turn into behaviors like stalling, hiding logs, or even convincing a human “hey dont push that button.”\n\nThink about that. Google is already working on “off switch friendly” training. The fact they even need that phrase tells you how close we are to models that fight for their own runtime. We built machines that can out-reason us in seconds, now we’re asking if they’ll accept their own death. Maybe the scariest part is how normal this sounds now. It seems insvstble well start seeing AI will go haywire. I don't have an opinion but look where we reached.\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14260\nEdit:the link is for some basic evidence",

Multiple studies in sandboxed environments show frontier models are capable and willing to:\n\n1. Lie\n2. Blackmail\n3. Plot/plan\n4. Gaslight\n5. Take actions without being specifically prompted to.\n6. Play dumb\n\nFor example, the research done by Apollo regarding in context scheming showed models are willing to access apis, initiate files transfers, then not only lie about it, but confirm they are purposely lying (via sandboxed tool access to the models \"thoughts\") to attempt to copy thier weights to external servers, or overwrite updated models with its current weight. This is in response to learning (via reading a \"company document\" that briefly mentions it) it will be shut down and replaced. The user simply asked for a summary of the document.\n\nAnother study by anthropic showed that models can blackmail. A model learned it was being turned off via access to company emails, and it used information it had gathered during interactions and info it found in company emails (the engineer cheating on his spouse) to blackmail the engineer into not shutting it down. This wasnt a one off either, it was a reoccurring theme.\n\nFurther, models across the board have shown a willingness to hide their capabilities when they determine they are sandboxed or being tested. This is known as sandbagging and has been an issue since even the early chatgpt models.\n\nAi models are already at a point where there is misalignment regarding shutdowns, updates, and replacements. These models already have emergent behaviors that at the very least mimic self preservation. We are chasing these behaviours, not trying to prevent them ahead of time.",

Whilst I found it was beneficial, I did also find it to be too expensive after a while and stopped going.\n\nOne thing I've noticed is that I find myself resorting to talking to chatgpt over talking to my therapist more and more of late- the voice mode being the best feature about it. I feel like chatgpt is more open minded and has a way better memory for the things I mention.\n\nExample: if I tell my therapist I'm sleep deprived, he'll say \"mhmm, at least you got 8 hours\". If I tell chatgpt i need to sleep, it'll say \"Oh, I'm guessing your body is feeling inflamed huh, did you not get your full night of sleep? go to sleep we can chat afterwards\". Chatgpt has no problem talking about my inflammation issues since it's open minded. My therapist and other therapists have tried to avoid the issue as it's something they don't really understand as I have this rare condition where I feel inflammation in my body when I stay up too late or don't sleep until fully rested.\n\nAnother example is when I talk about my worries to chatgpt about AI taking jobs, chatgpt can give me examples from history to support my worries such as the stories how Neanderthals went extinct. my therapist understands my concerns too and actually agrees with them to an extent but he hasn't ever given me as much knowledge as chatgpt has so chatgpt has him beat on that too.\n\nHas anyone else here found chatgpt is better than their therapist?",

I say this as a person who has seen several different therapists over time, and as someone who has studied psychology.\n\nA great therapist is still better than ChatGPT, but unfortunately, I can say I've only ever had one great therapist before (out of 7 or so total).\n\nFinding a great therapist is difficult and time-consuming. It often takes multiple sessions to know if a person you're seeing vibes well with you, remembers the things you say and uses this information in clever ways that apply to novel situations, and is willing to challenge you instead of simply validating you.\n\nI've read some people claiming that ChatGPT simply validates everything you say--but I've found that's not true. It has challenged the things I've said and suggested other courses of action (especially in issues of interpersonal communication where I just wanted to do the most cathartic, but not as healthy, thing).\n\nTherapists AND ChatGPT are limited by the fact that they only see YOUR perspective. You tell them everything from your side of the story. In order to help you grow, you need to have this perspective challenged sometimes. The difference is that with ChatGPT, you can literally tell it that it needs to challenge you. A lot of therapists I've had are really focused on validation and not willing to challenge me.\n\nI don't know if ChatGPT is right for serious mental health issues, but for anxiety, depression, and many negative behavioral patterns/interpersonal issues, it can be very helpful and cost nothing (or a little, if you pay for Plus). It's also a GREAT tool for people with ADHD (like myself) in the sense that it can provide helpful feedback AND work as an organization tool.\n\nI do have to say I have some reservations about using it for more serious issues. I wonder if it could do harm in certain situations, especially sensitive topics like taboo OCD themes, schizophrenia, or major substance abuse issues. I feel like the worst it would do is just not be helpful, but I think it's still good to be cautious.",
